# Kanagawa Theme
Kanagawa Theme for JetBrains IDEs

My port of KANAGAWA.nvim for Jetbrains IDEs. The color scheme and UI elements have been configured to match the original as closely as possible.

[Get it from the marketplace if it's up!](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19539-kanagawa-theme)

TODOS (a lot more than listed I just haven't found them yet):

- Make border colors better
- Incorporate Kanagawa's specific keyword palette with reds into the theme

Any feedback is well appreciated :)
